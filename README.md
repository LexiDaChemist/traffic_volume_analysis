# interstate-traffic-volume-analysis

Time-series analysis and visualization project focused on interstate traffic
volume patterns using Java. The project explores traffic trends over time,
identifies peak periods, and presents insights through visual charts.

# Interstate Traffic Volume Analysis (Java)

A Java-based data analysis and visualization project using interstate highway
traffic volume data. The goal is to analyze temporal traffic patterns, compute
summary statistics, and generate visualizations to support traffic trend
interpretation.

**Dataset:** Interstate Traffic Dataset (US)  
**Source:** :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
**Creator:** Ansh Tanwar  
All rights belong to the original dataset creator. The dataset is used for
educational and analytical purposes.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains hourly traffic volume data for an interstate highway,
along with associated weather and temporal attributes. It is suitable for
time-series analysis, peak traffic detection, and traffic volume visualization.

## Current Status
- Repository initialized and renamed  
- Project structure prepared for Java (Eclipse-compatible)  
- `data/raw/` directory configured for local dataset storage  

## Next Steps
- Implement CSV data parsing in Java  
- Perform exploratory traffic volume analysis  
- Generate visualizations (line charts and bar charts)  
- Identify peak traffic periods and trends
